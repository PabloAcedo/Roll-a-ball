# Roll-a-ball P4 Homework.
Interactive Systems UPF

For the session of P4, using the roll a ball from P1, I have implemented a setup to render the image in a panoramic display (from two differents points of view), added a minimap camera that shows the game from the top view and implemented a render texture from the view of a third camera.
